# Milestone Project 4: Backend Development (HTML5, CSS3, JAVASCRIPT, PYTHON, DJANGO, MYSQL)

The aim of this project is to design and build a front- and back-end interactive site that will allow the user to add data to its database. The user should be able to engage with the data and add / edit / delete the data on the site and purchase chosen items.

## Second Hand / Vintage Store
The idesa of this project is a second hand outlet of outfits that three main characters wear in the HBO series "And Just Like That". "And Just Like That" is a continuation of the hit "Sex and The City" tv show and originally this store was supposed to sell outfit from both shows but since the original series finished almost twenty years ago, it was better just to focus on the outfits from the new show.

So the idea is that the owner of the store collects whatever items can be found (from places like eBay, Vestiaire Collective, private collectors etc) and re-sales them on the website. It is quite hard to come across these items (but not impossible because it has been done in real life) therefore all the items in the store have quantity of 1. As the new chapter of the show was airing on HBO, every piece of wardrobe that was worn on it, becamey sold out on the spot.

For each item, the User sees a screenshot from the scene where it was worn and next to it there is a photo of the "real" item.

It is worth noticing that almost all the items that the main characters wear are high fashion, has very high prices on the items. The postal fee is only 2% of the order price but in this case it becomes a lot, however clothes like that cannot be delivered by standard mail, therefore the delivery fee is also used on postal insurance.

## User Experience(UX)

### User Stories

        1. First Time Visitors Goals:
        
            a. A First Time Visitor should be able to identify the purpose of the site by entering the main page which clearly states the purpose that it serves. Purchases can be made with or without registration to The Closet (the shop).

            b. A First Time Visitor should be able to easily navigate through the website's content. The menu is clearly separated from the rest of the content in both desktop and mobiles versions and the Search Bar is available as well.

        2. Returning / Frequent Visitor Goals: 

            a. A Returning Visitor (1) will come back for items if they find them interesting and affortable.

            b. A Returning Visitor (2) will come back to enjoy new contents of The Closet, possibly to buy more items if they can afford it. 

            c. A Returning Visitor (3) will come back for both options 1 and 2.

## Deployment

  The website was deployed on Heroku. In order to do so, I logged into my GitHub account, found the repository and then connected my GitHub account to my Heroku account and deployed it from there

  In order to clone this project and run it locally: 
   * log into GitHub account (using Chrome) 
   * install Gitpod extensions for Chrome 
   * restart the browser
   * go to the project's repository
   * click on the green Gitpod button - this will open a new workspace that will enable to work on the code locally


## Future Features

* UX improvements for readability
* Adding more characters from the show to the website
* Co-operation with the Instagram account where photos were found
